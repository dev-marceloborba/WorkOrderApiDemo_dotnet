This project sample is a demo based on a system that I was worked on in the past 4 years.

It's an ASP.NET 7 Web-API with the following resources/patterns:

- Vertical slice architecture
- Usage of EF Core
- Validation
- CQRS
- Minimal APIs

I'll update this repo to include more features. For now, it's a CRUD application to handle work orders.
